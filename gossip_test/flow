1. list all the pods whose nodes needs to be replaced, together with there nodes name.
2. list all the node ids mapping to above nodes.
3. drain the last not replaced pod.
4. terminate the node of the drained pod.
5. wait for the drained pod to running in UN status.
6. rebuild the new pod. (may need not, to be defined)
   if we logs similar to below, then step 6 could be skipped
   "INFO  2023-10-20 04:58:16,268 [shard 1] repair - Repair 1636 out of 3073 ranges, id=[id=2, uuid=5c824be9-e7f9-4b26-aaf1-30228aa53625], shard=1, keyspace=ycsb_1, table={usertable}, range=(539150944068228613, 541155779623768912], peers={10.0.8.175}, live_peers={10.0.8.175}"

7. go back to step 3 and repeat step 3-6 until all the pod nodes are replaced.


note: we could spawn all the needes nodes running 1.23 at first to speed up the whole roate process.
